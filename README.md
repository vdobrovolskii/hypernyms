# Hypernym prediction with recurrent networks

This is the implementation of the model described in "Regularizing Hypernym Prediction with Recurrent Networks" (not published yet). More details will appear on this page later.

The code uploaded as of today, 30.04.2019, is best viewed with Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com.

The version without Jupyter Notebook will be made available before 01.06.2019.

The word embedding model was downloaded from http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/11/182.zip and turned into a sense embedding model with the help of https://github.com/uhh-lt/sensegram. Alternatively, a pre-processed sense embedding model can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/open?id=18Ngd_ONLvaCicrmVWkoAkwCKarQg6OnN.
