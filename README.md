# Hypernym prediction with recurrent networks

This is the implementation of the model described in "Regularizing Hypernym Prediction with Recurrent Networks" (not published yet). More details will appear on this page later.

The code uploaded as of today, 30.04.2019, is best viewed with Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com.

The data files are located at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sD6Xi_muYeZoEDKSvJI7dvkR9kR2KXa8.

The version without Jupyter Notebook will be made available before 01.06.2019.

The word embedding model was downloaded from http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository/11/182.zip and turned into a sense embedding model with the help of https://github.com/uhh-lt/sensegram.

UPD 31.05.19: The combination of recurrent and neighbor regularization has been tested, so the publicly available code is to be updated. This should happen in June
